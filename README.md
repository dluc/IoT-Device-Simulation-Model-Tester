IoT Device Simulation Device Model Tester Overview
==================================================

This is a quick and easy way to test device models that are used in Azure IoT Device Simulation and Azure IoT Remote Monitoring. Drag and drop device model JSON files and the corresponding JavaScript behavior file to validate your model and behaviors are working as expected. You no longer need to deploy them, evaluate telemetry and repeat until things work.

This project includes a sample Model file (building-01.json) and a sample behavior file (building-01-state.js)
